<h3 class="nobreak" id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Act I.</span>—Dining-room at “High Up Farm.” The arrival of the
boarder from the city. The two letters. The farmer decides to
have his sailboat painted, since the summer boarders have begun
to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act II.</span>—Lawn at “High Up Farm.” Heartache is much perplexed.
Helen helps him fix it. The tramp. The plot. Hattie
is surprised. “He has disguised himself to test the depths of my
devotion.” The tramp tries to escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act III.</span>—Same as Act II. An embarrassing mistake. “Look
out for paint.” Miss Renwick decides that she don’t want a
husband. The widow wins. Bill settles it all.</p>

<h3>COSTUMES</h3>

<p>It will be necessary for Hattie and Helen to change. Hattie
is to be stylishly gowned in summer apparel when she enters in
first act. Helen to fit the occasion, as a farmer’s daughter when
at work about the house, and also “dressed up” to receive visitors.
Bill in ridiculous make-up and big straw hat. Percy in
rather dudish style. Roamer in ragged coat and overalls.
Hiram as a farmer at work. Hickory “dressed up” a little.
Lucinda as a widow just discarding her weeds. Susan with
apron, etc.</p>

<h3>PROPERTIES</h3>

<p>Churn, table, chairs, benches, etc., broom, feather duster and
ordinary furnishings for common sitting-room; table is set on lawn
during intermission between second and third acts Sign, “Cow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[4-5]</span>for Sale.” Two paint cans, with brushes.</p>

<p class="noindent">SCENE.—<em>Sitting-room of the “High Up Farmhouse.”</em></p>
</div>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Hiram Rodney</span>, <em>drying hands with big, coarse towel</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> So it’s city boarders we’re going to have, eh?
An’ one is comin’ to-day! Well, I don’t think a whole lot of
this pesky business, but Susan got it in her head to take ’em,
so I s’pose she’s got to have her way about it. Women-folks
generally does have their own way, anyhow. I know Susan
does; she always has, too. But it’s all right. A little cash
money from boarders will come in mighty handy, I calculate.
It’s been so dry that it looks as though the corn crop is going
to be a rank failure. An’ the hay——(<em>Voices and laughter
outside.</em>) Hello! What’s this? Bill has brought the new
boarder over from the depot, I s’pose. (<em>Goes to door at</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)
Yes, sure enough, she’s come. My! but ain’t she dressed up!
Paint an’ powder on her face, too! An’ Bill is luggin’ in her
trunk.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, <em>carrying trunk, followed by</em> <span class="smcap">Hattie Renwick</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Here we are, Mr. Rodney. I found her all right.
Ain’t she a stunner? I’ll bet that dress an’ hat of hers cost
more’n five dollars, bergosh! Ain’t she——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Shet up, you fool! Don’t you know how to act
when we’ve got company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>graciously</em>). Oh, don’t mind him. I think Bill is
just too cute for anything. He is so witty in his conversation
that I just enjoyed myself riding over from the depot. (<em>Laughs
lightly and glances killingly at</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, <em>who curtsies and then
struts around like a peacock</em>.) So this is High Up Farm, I
suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Yes, miss, that’s just what it is. Be you Miss
Hattie Renwick, the new boarder?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Yes, that is who I am, sir. I suppose you are Mr.
Rodney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> That’s me. I’m the boss of this here place—when
Susan ain’t around, I mean. (<em>Footsteps at</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>) Here
she comes now. She’ll look after you all right, miss. Susan
knows her business.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Susan Rodney</span>, <em>from kitchen at</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Mrs. Rodney, I presume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<em>bowing and smiling</em>). Yes, that’s who I be. You
are the young lady come here to board, I take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> That’s who she is, Susan. Jest look after her, will
you? (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>.) Take that trunk up-stairs, Bill, an’ hurry
up about it. I’ve got to send you back to the village before
you unhitch the mare. I wanted you to do an errand for me,
but you went off without me knowin’ it. Hurry up now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> All right. I’ll git this here trunk up-stairs in a jiffy.
(<em>Tries to lift trunk and falls over it.</em>) Gosh! I missed my
hold that time. (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Hat.</span>) Say, miss, there ain’t no crockery
in this, is there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>laughing</em>). No crockery, Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> All right, then.</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<span class="smcap">Hiram</span> <em>helps him and the two exeunt with trunk at</em> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>looking about room and breathing a sigh of relief</em>).
What a relief to get out of the crowded, dusty city. I am so
glad I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> You ought to be, Miss Renwick. There is nothing
like the dear old country, after all. Shall I show you to
your room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> If you please, Mrs. Rodney.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Hiram</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <em>Exeunt</em> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <em>and</em>
<span class="smcap">Hat.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Now, Bill, I want you to drive over to the village
and tell Jim Styles to send a man over here to paint ther boat
just as soon as he kin. Since we’re goin’ ter have boarders,
we’ve got to have the boat so they kin use it on the lake. Tell
him it’s white paint for the outside an’ yaller inside. Don’t
you forgit, Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> I won’t. But I’ll have to bring in an armful of wood
first. I seen there wasn’t any in ther wood-box when I come
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Mighty thoughtful of you all at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Say! but ain’t the new boarder a daisy?</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>Laughs uproariously.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Pshaw! You don’t think that city gal would take
any notice of you, do yer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> I don’t, eh? That’s as much as you know about it.
Why, she told me I was a fine specimen of a healthy young
farmer. (<em>Draws himself up proudly.</em>) An’ she give me a dig
in ther ribs, too. She’s a reg’lar peach! (<em>Laughs loudly again.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> You’re a born fool, Bill, an’ you don’t know it.
That gal was jest makin’ fun of yer, that’s all. &#160; &#160; [<em>Exeunt</em> <span class="smcap">Hiram</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Helen Rodney</span>, <em>with bunch of flowers in her hand</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> I see the buggy outside, so I suppose our boarder has
arrived. I wonder how she looks? She wrote that she is a
stenographer in New York, and the letter was typewritten, too.
By the way it read, she must be very much of a lady. Well,
as there is no one here now, I’ll take my chance to write a note
to Percy. I know mother won’t object, so I’ll invite him over
to take tea with us to-morrow afternoon. Percy is just too
sweet for anything; and he is an artist, too! I hope the new
boarder is not good-looking, so there will be no danger of her
cutting me out. (<em>Opens drawer in stand and takes out paper,
pen and ink and writes.</em>) There! (<em>Holds up note she has
written.</em>) That is rather brief, but it will answer the purpose,
I know. Percy will be delighted to come, too. When mother
and father see him and get acquainted with him they won’t
mind if he comes often, I am sure. (<em>Reads.</em>) “Dear Percy,
come over to-morrow afternoon and take tea with us. Pa
and ma will be pleased to see you. Yours lovingly, H. R.”
(<em>Places paper in envelope and addresses it.</em> <span class="smcap">Bill</span> <em>is heard
whistling outside</em>.) Here, Bill, I want you. Hurry up.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">(<span class="smcap">Bill</span> <em>enters on a run and stumbles, throwing an armful of
wood on the floor</em>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span> (<em>on his hands and knees</em>). What do yer want, Helen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Get up, stupid. I want you to take this letter to the
post-office some time to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span> (<em>taking letter</em>). All right, Helen. I’ve got to go to
ther village right away, an’ I’ll mail ther letter for yer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Well, see that you don’t lose it. Here is ten cents
for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Hooray! I’ll buy a mouth-organ now. Then I’ll
make some mew-sick around High Up Farm, see if I don’t.
Helen, you never heard me play a mouth-organ, did yer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> No; and I don’t wish to hear you, either. Just pick
up that wood and be off with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span> (<em>gathering up the sticks of wood</em>). All right, Helen.
I forgot to thank you for this dime.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">(<em>Puts coin in mouth and then goes off</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Oh! Here is pen, ink and paper. Just what I
want. I wonder if I could get that simple fellow, Bill, to go
over to the post-office? I must let Percy know I am here.
Won’t he be surprised! What a romance, indeed. We have
never seen each other, nor even exchanged photographs, but I
am sure he loves me, or he would never have answered my
second letter after reading my advertisement in a matrimonial
paper. When I found High Up Farm was so near the village
he is stopping in I could not make arrangements to come here
quickly enough. How delightful! How romantic! I’ll just
write him a few words to let him know I am here. I will ask
him to come over to-morrow afternoon. Just think of it!
How romantic it will be! I am sure I will know him, for I
can imagine just how he looks from his letters. And he is an
artist, too. Very, very romantic! (<em>Sits down and writes.</em>)
There! I think this will do. (<em>Reads.</em>) “Dear Percy: I
have just arrived at High Up Farm and will be pleased to meet
you here to-morrow afternoon. I know how surprised you will
be when you read this, and feel sure that when you see me you
will not be sorry you answered my matrimonial advertisement,
which was really inserted more in a spirit of mischief than anything
else. Yours, lovingly, H. R.” (<em>To audience.</em>) That
ought to land him, if anything will. Since I have decided to
get married, I must go the limit. I must land this handsome
young artist—I know he must be handsome, for artists always
are—and I will surely look my best to-morrow afternoon. I
wonder where that big booby, Bill, is? (<span class="smcap">Bill</span> <em>heard whistling
outside</em>.) Oh! there he is now. (<em>Walks to</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>) Come here,

That’s a good boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Mother, I have asked a young man to come over
and take tea with us to-morrow. You don’t object, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Young man? You mean that painter you’ve talked
so much about in the last week or two, I s’pose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Not painter, mother. He is an artist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, ain’t a painter an artist? I call him a
painter, an’ I don’t think he amounts to much, though I ain’t

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>taking</em> <span class="smcap">Susan’s</span> <em>face in her hands</em>). Oh, mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
you will surely change your opinion when you see him once.
He is just too sweet for anything. He is very wealthy, too,
and I happen to know that he has more than an ordinary fondness
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<em>disengaging herself from</em> <span class="smcap">Hel.</span>). All girls are
alike at your age. Well, let him come, if he wants to. I was
thinking of inviting the widow over to-morrow afternoon, so
Miss Renwick would have company. Most likely she’ll find it
rather lonesome here at first. Hick Homespun told your father
he was coming over to look at the brindle cow which is for sale,
to-morrow afternoon, so it will just come in fine. The widow
has set her cap for Hick, an’ I’ve made up my mind to help
her along all I can. Yes. Let the painter come over, an’ we’ll
have a little party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> And we won’t say anything about it to father, or
the boarder, mother. Let’s make it a surprise party, as far as
they are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Very well, Helen. I was goin’ to tell your father,
but if you want him surprised it’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Where is the new boarder, mother? I haven’t
seen her yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> She is up in her room. She seems to be a very
nice girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Is she good-looking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Very. She reminds me of one of them pictures you

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Has Bill gone yet, Mrs. Rodney? I have just discovered

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> I am very glad to meet her, I am sure. How do you
do, Miss Rodney? (<em>They shake hands.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> I am quite well, I thank you. I hope you will like
it here at High Up Farm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> I hope so; but it does seem rather slow here at the
start. You see, I am so used to the gay life of the city, with
the theatre parties every night or two, and the receptions and
balls. It is so different in the country. But I will get used to
it, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Miss Renwick, do stenographers have such enjoyment
in the city? They must draw large salaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Oh, they do. But of course they don’t use their own
money for such pleasures. The fellows attend to that part of
it—young men interested in Wall Street, and the like, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Oh, I see. It must be delightful to live in the city
and be a stenographer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> What do yer want, Missus Rodney? You jest

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>smiling graciously</em>). It is I who want you, Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Oh, it’s you, eh, Daisy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> What did I tell you about calling me Daisy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Excuse me. I’ll change it an’ call you Peach, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Stop your nonsense, Bill. (<em>Takes money from purse
and hands it to him.</em>) There! Stop at the drug store and
get me a box of tooth powder. If you can’t get powder, get
paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> An’ if I can’t git paste I’ll git a bottle of mucilage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> The idea, Bill! Mucilage! People don’t use
such stuff as that to clean their teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> If they was false it would be good to stick ’em to
ther gums.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>sharply</em>). Bill, I want you to understand that my

<p><span class="smcap">Bill.</span> Of course, Daisy—I mean Peach. Whose would they
be? If you’ve got false ones most likely you paid for ’em.
Whose would they be? (<em>Goes to door at</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, <em>laughing</em>.) But
all right, Peach. I’ll git ther tooth powder for yer. I won’t
forgit. I’m goin’ to buy a set of clappers with that quarter you
give me afore. Then, with a new mouth-organ an’ ther clappers,
there’ll be a regular band of music around High Up Farm. &#160; &#160; [<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Mother, that boy is getting to be a regular nuisance.
The idea of him speaking that way to a stranger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Oh! I don’t mind him, Miss Rodney. Bill isn’t
exactly all right. I noticed that when he met me at the depot.
He means no offense, I am sure. His comical actions and remarks
help take away the dullness. Bill is all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, we’ve had him ever since he was about ten
years old, an’ he’s always been pretty faithful. I s’pose he
can’t help it if he’s a little loose in his upper story. Most
likely he was born that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Quite likely, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>sitting down</em>). Miss Helen, are there many good-looking
young farmers around here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> There are plenty of young men in the neighborhood,
Miss Renwick. But as to their good looks, I suppose you
would be better able to judge than I. You reside in the city,
and I presume you see so many handsome young men that you
would not think much of those you will meet here in the country.
As for myself, I don’t care a great deal for farmers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Shame on you, Helen! You, a farmer’s daughter,
talkin’ like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> I can’t help it, mother; just because I was born
on a farm don’t say that I should be a farmer’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Why, I think that would be delightful, provided the
husband could give his wife all she wanted. Plenty of fine
dresses, a horse and carriage, and a nice automobile. Farmers
usually are very wealthy, I have heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, there ain’t many rich ones around here, Miss
Renwick. About the only one anywhere around here who’s
got plenty of money is Hick Homespun, an’ his father left it to
him. Hick never earned it, though he does know pretty well
how to keep it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Hick Homespun! What a funny name, Mrs.
Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Yes, it is a sorter old-fashioned name. But Hick
is all right, just the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> His given name is Hickory, but every one calls
him Hick, for short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> Is he married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> No, he is a bachelor farmer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> But he ain’t likely to remain a bachelor very long.
Lucinda Wheatchaff, the widow, has set her cap for him. She’ll
catch him, too, for Lucinda has very winnin’ ways. She made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
up her mind to get Hank Wheatchaff, an’ she jest went ahead
an’ got him. But Hank didn’t live more’n a year, an’ when
he died he left the widow a nice little farm an’ a few thousands
in cash. Lucinda will win Hick all right, though he’s an awful
bashful man. She’ll—— (<em>Knock at door</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) As I live! I
believe that’s the widow now. I always know her knock.
(<em>Calls out.</em>) Come in.</p>

<p class="center noindent"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Lucinda Wheatchaff</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Hello, everybody! Isn’t this a lovely day? (<em>Sees</em>
<span class="smcap">Hat.</span>) Oh! excuse me, Mrs. Rodney. I wasn’t aware that
you had company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<em>introducing them</em>). Mrs. Wheatchaff, this is our
new boarder, Miss Renwick, of New York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> How do you do, Miss Renwick? We country folks
are always glad to meet city folks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>graciously</em>). It gives me great pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Mrs. Wheatchaff.</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>They shake hands, the widow very demonstrative.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Lucinda, I was just telling Miss Renwick about
Hick. She wanted to know if there were any nice young men
around here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> Oh, she wanted to know that, eh? (<em>Sizes up</em> <span class="smcap">Hat.</span>
<em>critically, and then gives a sniff</em>.) Well, I hardly think Hick
Homespun would suit her. Hick has got an awful objection
to paint and powder, too. He wouldn’t be apt to take to Miss
Renwick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat.</span> (<em>with sweet sarcasm</em>). Indeed! Mrs. Wheatchaff,
you are very blunt in your way of speaking, I see. But if the
gentleman referred to objects to paint and powder, how do you
ever expect to win him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luc.</span> (<em>holding up her hands in surprise</em>). Me? As if I
wanted another man! I’ve had one, and I am sure that is
enough. (<em>Picks up her parasol and walks about indignantly.</em>)
But say! (<em>Pauses before</em> <span class="smcap">Hat.</span> <em>and shakes parasol at her</em>.)
If you think you can get Hick Homespun to take any notice of
you, go ahead. I’m sure it is nothing to me. But I don’t believe——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>perplexed</em>). Well, this is a great state of affairs. I
don’t know how I am to get out of the mess I am in. Who
would ever have dreamed of such a thing as that girl I corresponded
with through the foolish matrimonial advertisement
would be here? Why, I never saw her, and I only answered
her letters for fun. The idea of her going so far as to come
here to board! It is ridiculous. But to make matters worse
(<em>shaking his head sadly</em>) Helen sends me an invitation to
come over this afternoon and get acquainted with her parents.
The two letters arrived at the same time, and both bear the
same initials. (<em>Takes letters from pocket and again shakes his

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Yes, Miss Rodney. I came over a little early, because
I have something to say to you. It is of a rather serious
nature, and has been worrying me ever since I went to the
post-office last night. (<em>Walks to</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>aside</em>). Gracious! It can’t be that he is going to
propose. (<em>Walks toward</em> <span class="smcap">Percy</span>.) What is it, Mr. Heartache?
Perhaps I might be able to advise you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>brightening up</em>). I am sure you can, Helen—I
mean Miss Rodney. I surely am in a bad fix. But sit down
here and I’ll tell you all about it.</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>They sit upon bench near</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Go on and tell me. I am sure your troubles cannot

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Wait until you have heard. Helen—excuse me
for calling you Helen——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Certainly. To be even with you, I shall call you
Percy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I like that. But let me tell my story. Perhaps
after you have heard it you won’t want to ever see me again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Is it so serious as all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> It surely is. Helen, a month or so ago I was foolish
enough to answer an advertisement in a matrimonial paper.
I did it just for the fun of the thing, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> I did the same thing once. A bachelor, whose chief
drawing points were that he was bald-headed and had a fortune,
advertised that he wished to correspond with a charming country
girl who was matrimonially inclined, and I wrote to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Ah! is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Yes; but there was no harm in it, was there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span>. Certainly not. How many letters did you write to
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Only one. I did not answer the one I received in
reply, for it seemed as though he meant business, and what
did I want of an old bald-headed man, even if he was rich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Of course you didn’t want him. But to be real
serious, Helen. The fix I am in at present is all through answering
an advertisement in a matrimonial paper. I wrote to
the young lady twice, and it seems that she took it altogether
too seriously. The fact is, Helen, that she is here, and she
has invited me to call at your father’s house this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>rising excitedly</em>). What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Just what I say. Haven’t you a young lady stopping
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Why—er—yes. But——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Isn’t her name Hattie Renwick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>completely amazed</em>). Yes, that is her name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Read this note and you will understand it all.
(<em>Hands her</em> <span class="smcap">Hattie’s</span> <em>note</em>.) I hope you will forgive me,
Helen. I will never do such a foolish thing again as long as I
live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>reading note aloud</em>). Well, I declare! If this isn’t
a remarkable coincidence. Why, she must have sent this to
the post-office with Bill when I sent mine yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I received the two invitations at the same time.
Imagine my surprise, and my feelings, too, when I read them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Well, I am not a bit jealous of her, Percy. I consider
this a great joke, indeed I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Oh, do you? You are not angry, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Angry? No. But say, Percy, if you could only
get some one to come here and represent himself to be Percy
Heartache, what a joke it would be! Miss Renwick is an old
maid, and the way she paints her face is disgusting. Imagine
her wanting to marry a handsome young artist! Why, she is
artist enough herself.</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>Laughs lightly, and</em> <span class="smcap">Percy</span>, <em>much relieved, joins in</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I wish I knew how to get out of this. Your suggestion
is a good one, but who could I get to represent himself
to be me? I suppose I might go back to the village and find
some one, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>eagerly</em>). Do it, Percy. You can find somebody who
would do it just for the fun of it. I will tell mother about it.

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Yes, mother, let me introduce you to Mr. Heartache.
He is the young man I spoke to you about—the artist, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> So he is the painter, eh? How do you do, Mr.

You have a beautiful place here, Mrs. Rodney. High Up
Farm is well named. The land is very high and level here
and the pure air is simply delightful. The scenery is grand,
too, and I mean to make some sketches of it, if I receive permission
to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<em>surprised</em>). Why, I don’t know, unless it was to
get away from the city for a while and enjoy herself in the
fresh country air. What do you mean, Helen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Well, I’ll tell you, mother. She came here so she
could get acquainted with Mr. Heartache. It seems that he
answered a matrimonial advertisement she inserted in some
paper, and when she answered him he wrote again, giving his
address at the village. She discovered that our farm was right
near the village, so she came here. Percy—I mean Mr. Heartache—never
saw Miss Renwick, and he cares nothing for her,
whatever. She had the audacity to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Why, Helen, what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Listen, mother. Let me finish. She had the audacity
to send Mr. Heartache a note, inviting him here to-day.
I invited him, too, as you are aware. Now, he does not want
to let the brazen old maid know who he is, and we were just
talking and trying to think of some way to play a joke on her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, if that is why she came to High Up Farm I
think she ought to have a joke played on her. I have a notion
to go right now and tell her what I think of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Don’t do it, mother. She is getting along in years,
and she no doubt wants to get a husband so badly that she can
be excused. What we want you to do is to help us in this. It
will only be a little harmless fun, and Percy will be spared
the scene that would surely follow if she met him, thinking he
had come here for the purpose of meeting her. Percy is going
to the village and will try to get some one to impersonate him.
Of course it will not be a good-looking young man he will get,
either, and there is where the fun will come in. Now, mother,
do help us out, won’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<em>shaking her head, as though in doubt</em>). I don’t like
this kind of business, Helen. But since Mr. Heartache seems
to be such a nice young man, an’ he is a painter, besides, I’ll
do as you want me to. The idea of Miss Renwick comin’ here
for the purpose of tryin’ to catch a husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Oh, mother, I am so glad. Now, then, if a man
comes here and is introduced as Mr. Percy Heartache, you will
know what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Yes; I’ll call Miss Renwick right away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Well, Mr. Trotwell Roamer, there is a young lady
in the house who is expecting a call from a young man she has
never seen. She is looking for a husband, and she will no

<p><span class="smcap">Roam.</span> (<em>looking at his overalls and ragged coat and laughing</em>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Well, I don’t know why she wouldn’t be, boss. But go
ahead with your game. Let me see the color of that five-spot
first. Then I’ll feel more like listenin’ to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>producing a five-dollar bill</em>). There you are. Now,
then, is it a go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roam.</span> You bet it is. But say! there ain’t no danger of a
breach of promise suit in this, is there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>laughing</em>). I hardly think so. Now, to be brief
about it, all you have got to do is to say that you are Percy
Heartache, the artist. You can say it to any one you meet, for
that matter. But the young lady—Hattie Renwick is her
name—is the party the joke is to be on. She has been corresponding
with you, you know, and has thrown out her net to
catch you for a husband. Do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roam.</span> (<em>shaking his head</em>). Putty well, boss. I’m Percy
Heartache, the artist, an’ she’s tryin’ to nail me for a husband.
Yes, that’s all right.</p>

I’ll bet that young lady won’t want no artist for a husband
after she’s talked to me a while. I’ll settle her matrimonial
aspirations, all right. Give me that five-spot, an’ the thing
will be done in fine shape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>handing him the five-dollar bill</em>). I am sure you’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span> (<em>ignoring the question and pointing to paint cans</em>).

disguised yourself as a common laborer or tramp for the purpose

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> (<em>thinking</em> <span class="smcap">Percy</span> <em>is surely the painter sent over by
Jim Styles to paint the boat</em>). Well, what do you think of
her? Are you going to start in to-day? It seems a little late.
But maybe you’ve just brought over your paint, so you can
start in the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>looking at what he has in his hands, and very much
confused</em>). Why, I—er——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> That’s all right. To-morrer mornin’ will do. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
guess she can wait till that time. But say, young feller, you
must go easy when you tip her over, ’cause her stays might
break. They’re pretty old, and I don’t want to put no more
expense on her than I kin help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>aside</em>). Heavens! What is the man driving at?
He must be crazy! To speak of his own daughter in this
way! What does it mean?</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>Backs toward</em> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <em>still holding cans and overalls</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Where are you goin’? Come on over to the lake,
and we’ll look her over together. (<em>Turns to</em> <span class="smcap">Hick</span>.) You
come, too, Hick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Certain I will, Hiram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>much confused</em>). I—er—think there must be some
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Mistake, eh? Well, I guess not. You was sent
for, wasn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Yes, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Maybe you don’t like the looks of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Oh, yes, I do, Mr. Rodney. She is the nicest——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> (<em>laughing heartily</em>). He ain’t much of a judge, is
he, Hiram?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Well, I don’t know. He looks as though he ought
to know a good model from a bad one. But say. (<em>Nods to
Percy.</em>) If you feel like it, and think it ain’t too late, you
might start in to scrapin’ the paint off her sides right now.
You’ll find she’s pretty well roughed up; but you can fix that
all right. You’ll have to go a bit careful when you come to
the waist. She’s been layin’ on one side so long that I s’pose
the sun has done some damage. Most likely she’s blistered a
little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Blistered!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Blistered, of course. There ain’t nothing strange
about that, is there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Jim Styles told you it was to be white outside and
yaller inside, didn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>stepping back and turning to audience</em>). Ah!
Now I know there is a mistake. He does not refer to his
daughter at all. (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Hiram</span>.) Pardon me, Mr. Rodney, but
to whom or what are you referring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> (<em>turning to</em> <span class="smcap">Hick</span>. <em>and showing surprise</em>). Well,
what do you think of that, Hick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Must be a born fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> He don’t know what he was sent over here for, it
seems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Seems not. (<em>Nods head gravely.</em>) He don’t look
like a painter, anyhow, Hiram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> But he’s got everything with him to do the job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I did not come here to do any work. These things
(<em>setting them down near</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) belong to another party. I just
picked them up to set them aside as you came here. I am
not a painter, but an artist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Well, I swan!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> (<em>showing surprise</em>). So you didn’t come here to
paint our boat, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>much relieved</em>). I certainly did not, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> What did you come here for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I came at the invitation of your daughter Helen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Jumpin’ bullfrogs! What do you think of that,
Hick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Sort of a misunderstandin’, it seems. (<em>He laughs.</em>)
He thought you was speakin’ of Helen, and you was meanin’
the old boat all the time. (<em>Laughs uproariously.</em>) Oh, dear!
What a joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Well, I am very sorry that such a mistake should
be made. But I can easily understand now. It is rather unfortunate,
but no harm has been done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Not as I knows of, young fellow. So Helen invited
you to come over, did she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> Yes, she did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Well, I reckon I had better call her out, then.
(<em>Calls to</em> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>) Helen! Helen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>unseen by audience</em>). What is it, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Yes, I know. Let me introduce you to him, father.
(<em>Turns to</em> <span class="smcap">Percy</span>.) Mr. Roamer, this is my father. (<span class="smcap">Percy</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy</span> (<em>laughingly</em>). Which, I guess. (<em>Shakes with</em> <span class="smcap">Hick</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> What do you think, Helen? Your father was talkin’
about havin’ his boat scraped an’ painted, an’ this young man
thought he was meanin’ you all the time. Funny mistake,
wasn’t it? (<em>Laughs heartily.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> I should say it was a funny mistake, Hick. How
did it happen, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Well, I was expectin’ a painter to come over to
paint the boat white outside and yaller inside, an’ when I seen
this young man standin’ here with them things (<em>pointing to
cans and overalls</em>) in his hands, I thought he was the man. I
didn’t know he had come over on an invite from you. But
(<em>looking at the table</em>) what’s goin’ on, anyhow? What have
you got the table set outside for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> Oh! we are going to have a little party. Mother
thought it would be a good idea to have some company over,
so the new boarder wouldn’t be lonesome. (<em>Turns to</em> <span class="smcap">Hick</span>.)
The widow is here, too, Hick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> (<em>looking around in a startled way</em>). Where is she,
Helen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>laughing</em>). Around somewhere. We are going to
have a very nice time, I am sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> (<em>edging toward</em> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>). I’m goin’ home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> (<em>catching him by the arm</em>). No, you don’t, Hick!
You ain’t afraid of the widder any more than I am. You are
goin’ to stay right here an’ have tea with us. Besides, I want
to sell you that cow before you go home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> Well, I’ll take her, Hiram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hel.</span> (<em>laughing</em>). The widow, Hick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> (<em>excitedly</em>). No! The cow, I mean. I’ll be over
after her in the mornin’.</p>

<p class="center noindent">(<em>Tries to go again, but is restrained by</em> <span class="smcap">Hiram</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram.</span> Now, see here, Hick Homespun. The trouble
with you is that you’re a lot too bashful. You know well
enough that you ought to have somebody around that nice little
home of yours to cook your meals an’ fetch your slippers for
you nights when you come in after doin’ a hard day’s work.
There’s the Widder Wheatchaff for you, Hick! She’s a fine

<p><span class="smcap">Hick.</span> (<em>becoming interested</em>). How do you know that?</p>

to her, and when he found she was willing to consider
it he changed his mind and tried to get away. She gave
pursuit, and Bill and Lucinda, who happened to be here,
helped her catch him. Miss Renwick is anxious to marry
some one, and after corresponding with the man she set her
cap for him before she had even seen him. Mother and I

<h3>THE NEW CRUSADE</h3>

<p class="noindent center fs120">A Comedy in Two Acts</p>

<p class="noindent center"><em>By Rachel Baker Gale</em></p>

<p>Twelve females. Costumes, modern; scenery, two interiors. Plays one
hour and thirty minutes. A very amusing satire of the servant girl question,
brimful of telling incidents and effective lines. All the parts are
good and of nearly equal opportunity, and practically play themselves.
Well rehearsed, it is a sure success and goes with a scream. Irish, negro
and Swede character parts and a “tough” girl. Strongly recommended
for ladies’ clubs. Can be played only on payment of a royalty of $5.00
to the author.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
